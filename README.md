# Neural-Style-Transfer

This project applies Neural Style Transfer to blend the content of one image with the artistic style of anotherâ€”such as applying the brushstrokes of a famous painting to a photo. Using deep neural networks, particularly convolutional layers, the model extracts content and style representations and recombines them into a visually stunning output. This technique enables creative transformations and is widely used in AI art generation, design, and digital media. A perfect mix of deep learning and artistic expression.
